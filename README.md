Jonion is a lightweight, flexible plugin framework for Java applications.
It provides a clean, modular architecture that makes it easy to build extensible systems by “layering” functionality through plugins.

## ✨ Features
- Lightweight & Simple — a clean, minimal API for easy integration.
- Per-Module Configurations — automatic configuration handling for each plugin.
- Descriptor System — built-in support for module metadata and custom descriptor templates.
- Multi-format Support — YAML out of the box, with adapters for any other format.
- Extensible — customize loaders, lifecycles, and file formats with ease.
…and more. Designed to grow with your application's needs.

Because good apps, like onions, have **layers**. Java software benefits from modularity — Jonion makes that possible.

(And because naming things is hard.)
